PROJECTS
--------
- P1: Two simple JavaScript programs: one which prints the current day of the week to the console and one which prints 5 to 26 random lowercase letters of the english alphabet to the console.
- P2: A JavaScript program that prints 10 to 20 random lowercase letters of the english alphabet sorted alphabetically and an identical program that uses function expressions instead of regular functions.
- P3: A JavaScript program with an html frontend that can calculate every possible combination of US coins to amount to an inputted number of cents and also calculate the total value in dollars and cents of an inputted assortment of different US coins.
- P4: A Node.JS REST API server that uses express and the HTTP GET verb to fetch data from the server dependent on the route.
- P5: A simple turn-based RPG where you fight against a group of goblins, deciding between defending and attacking in between waves of their attacks. The underlying code uses an object-oriented system to track various stats that change or need to be referenced throughout the game, and the whole thing is hosted locally on a node.js server and an html webpage which provides a visual interface for the player to play the game.
- P6: A grocery list manager. While running, the server holds a grocery list that can be edited in one of several: items can be added, items can be deleted, items can be “checked” via checkboxes, and checked items can subsequently be deleted. The underlying code uses a simple class system to create and manage new groceries and the list as a whole, and it interfaces with an html frontend hosted locally on a node.js server.
